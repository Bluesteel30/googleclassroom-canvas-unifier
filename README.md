# googleclassroom-canvas-unifier
This is a project with the goal of unifying Canvas and Google Classroom. This problem stems from having all but one teacher using Classroom, and the other using Canvas. This creates an inconvience in checking nightly homework and this project aims to eliminate that. I started this project over the summer and am adding it to GitHub.
